# B. Categorical Explanatories

## 1.

```{r}
# read data
ins = read.csv("Insurance.csv")

# convert categorical variables to factors
ins$zone = as.factor(ins$zone)
ins$make = as.factor(ins$make)

# filter claims larger than 0
ins = ins[ins$claims>0,]

# 1797 observations
dim(ins)
```

## (a)

```{r}
mod = lm(per ~ ., data = ins)
summary(mod)
```

## i.

```{r}
coef(mod)
length(coef(mod))
```

There are 19 parameters are estimated. 

\bigskip

## ii.

```{r}
cat(coef(mod)["(Intercept)"])
```
When `make` and `zone` are both at their first level, 1 the intercept of the regression is 11.862.

\bigskip

## iii.

```{r}
cat(coef(mod)["(Intercept)"] + coef(mod)["make9"] + coef(mod)["zone7"])
```

When `make` and `zone` are both at their last levels, 9 and 7 respectively the intercept of the regression is 10.45915.
